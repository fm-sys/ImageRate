"ImageRate" is a user-friendly Windows app designed for rating and organizing pictures. With its simple and intuitive interface, users can easily assign rating stars to their images, helping them categorize and prioritize their photo collection. This small yet effective tool is perfect for individuals who want to manage and curate their photos with ease.

## Usage hints

When using this program, it will add "rating" metadata tags to your images. To access the rating via the windows file explorer, just can just group or sort the folder by rating.

I'm personally using this program to rate images, and I've found a workflow that works quite well for me. To start off, every image begins with zero stars by default. I go through them once, giving each one at least the first star if it's not completely bad. Then, I revisit the images, adding a star to the ones I like, and I gradually raise my standards with each round. I keep repeating this process until I've narrowed down the number of images to a manageable size. It's a pretty effective method, and I'd recommend giving it a try!

### Keybord shortcuts

To make working with app even more efficient, we added several keyboard shortcuts:
-  `0`-`5` - set rating to specific value
- `+` - increase rating by one
- `-` - degrease rating by one
- arrow `left`/`right` - navigate between images
